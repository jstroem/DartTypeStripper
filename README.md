DartTypeStripper
================

Simple Command line tool to remove types from dart programs.

## Introduction

This tool is written by Jesper Lindstr√∏m Nielsen and Troels Leth Jensen as part of a study in Dart at Aarhus University @ 2014.

## Install

When cloned you should get the packages needed to use via. `pub build`.

## Run

To use the tool just do:

	./strip.dart [-p] [-o dir] file(s)

The tool implement these flags:

Partial `-p` or `--partial` that disables type stripping from method and function signatures.

Similarly, '-g' or '--keep-generics' preserves any naked generic types, i.e. T will be kept but List<T> will be removed in a class where T is a type argument.

Output `-o` or `--output` gives the location to place the stripped files. If absent output will be printed to stdout.



## Tests

We have tested this tool on all the official dart samples and the packages they use. All tests were positive, this means that if you have a working program with types you can remove them using this tool and the stripped version will work.
