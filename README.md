DartTypeStripper
================

Simple Command line tool to remove types from dart programs.

## Introduction

This tool is written by Jesper Lindstr√∏m Nielsen and Troels Leth Jensen as part of a study in Dart at Aarhus University @ 2014.

## Install

When cloned you should get the packages needed to use via. `pub build`.

## Run

To use the tool just do:

	./strip.dart [-p] [-o dir] file(s)

There is two optional flags to put in.

Partial `-p` or `--partial` that disables type stripping from method and function signatures.

Output `-o` or `--output` gives the location to place the stripped files. If absent output will be printed to stdout.

## Tests

We have tested this tool on all the official dart samples and the packages they use. All tests were positive, this means that if you have a working program with types you can remove them using this tool and the stripped version will work.
