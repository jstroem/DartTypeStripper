## Swipe

This sample uses touch gestures and CSS 3D transforms to display a figure made
up of a well known palindrome.

You can open the example in Dart Editor and run it by clicking
`web/swipe.html`.
Or, you can try this
[live demo](http://www.dartlang.org/samples/swipe/).

If you are using a keyboard, spin the figure with the left and
right arrow keys. On touch devices, use swipe gestures.

Please report any [bugs or feature requests](http://dartbug.com/new).
