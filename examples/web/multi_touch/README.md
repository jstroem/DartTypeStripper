## multi_touch

A sample app that shows the use of multiple touch events in a browser.

This sample is mostly a port of the mutli-touch example found at:
https://github.com/paulirish/demo/blob/master/js/multitouch.js

The author information in the original is reproduced:

    canvasDrawr originally from Mike Taylr  http://miketaylr.com/
    Tim Branyen massaged it: http://timbranyen.com/
    and i did too. with multi touch.
    and boris fixed some touch identifier stuff to be more specific.

To run this app, open it on a device that supports multiple touch events. This
includes most mobile phones, and touch enabled devices like the Chrome Pixel.
