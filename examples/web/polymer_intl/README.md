## A polymer component with localized messages

A simple demonstration of internationalization/localization
with Polymer components. It defines a Polymer component that lets you
choose from a selection of locales and displays a message translated
for the selected locale.

The component is defined in localized.html and localized.dart, and the
main entry point is polymer_intl.html
